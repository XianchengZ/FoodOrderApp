            <p>
        This is a Japanese Rrestaurant that Andrew Zang personally like the most in the Kichener-Waterloo Region. There are two restaurants, one in Kitchener and one in Waterloo to be convinient for UWaterloo students.
                </p>
            <p>
        It is a place perfectly for dating. Boys, take girls there and you won't regret it.
